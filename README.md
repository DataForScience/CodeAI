## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need all three tools?**
A: For the full course experience, yes. But all offer free tiers, so there's no upfront cost.

**Q: Can I just use one tool?**
A: You could, but learning all three helps you understand their different strengths and choose wisely.

**Q: Will these tools make me a worse programmer?**
A: Not if used correctly! The course emphasizes understanding AI code and maintaining core skills.

**Q: What if the tools update during the course?**
A: Core concepts remain stable. We'll note major changes and update materials accordingly.

**Q: How long does it take to get proficient?**
A: Basic proficiency: 1-2 weeks per tool. Mastery: 2-3 months of daily use.

**Q: Can I use these tools at work?**
A: Check your company's policy. Most allow them; some require privacy mode.

**Q: Are there any alternatives to the tools covered?**
A: Yes (GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, etc.), but these three represent different paradigms well.

**Q: Will AI replace software developers?**
A: No. AI augments developers but can't replace human judgment, creativity, and domain knowledge.
